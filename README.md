# SecretSantaApp
<p>Nice app with using AngularJS on front and Java REST API on back</p>
<p></p>
All application architecture made by myself. Application has only one user, but in different situations have different roles.  User can admin "room", can take order for gift from "need for gift" person and give order for gift as "need for gift" person to own "secret santa". Application works with database and entities using ORM technology(Hibernate). Backend of application work as REST services, which uses JAX-RS technology. Frontend made using AngularJS. I used many not official Google modules, like angular-translate, angular-jwt, angular-ui-bootstrap and etc. Security: Application uses Auth0 JWT technology. Perfomance testing: All REST services was tested using Apache JMeter.
